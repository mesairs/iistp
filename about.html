                Imus Institute is the oldest non-sectarian co-education private school in Cavite, offering a complete
                Academic Secondary Course recognized by the government. Founded by citizens led by Manuel and Lorenzo
                Paredes, the school aimed to provide affordable elementary and secondary education to the youth. Key
                officers and members of the Board of Trustee included Manuel C. Paredes, Lorenzo B. Paredes, Epifanio S.
                Paredes, Remedios Monzon-Paredes, and Benito V. Rementilla. An Honorary Board of Trustees was also
                established.
            </p>
            <span> &nbsp;</span>
            <p>
                The Ymus Central Academy was established in 1923 as a non-stock family corporation under the Bureau of
                Commerce and Industry. Its formal opening began on June 12, 1923, and continued throughout the school
                year.
                The academy was chosen for its location in Imus, a town near Manila and one of the largest in Cavite,
                and
                its proximity to the capital city and the province's main transportation lines. The founders of the
                academy
                outlined their objectives and philosophy for the establishment of the school.
            </p>
            <span> &nbsp;</span>
            <p>
                To help the parents of Imus and neighboring towns with limited means to give their children quality
                education;
                To instill in the minds of the students the irreversible truth that an individual is destined to achieve
                something to meet the exigencies of life;
                To make the students realize that success depend mainly upon their own untiring efforts so that they can
                discover for themselves their hidden talents, power and capabilities; and
                To attend strictly to the development of the mind and the molding of the character of the students.
            </p>
            <span> &nbsp;</span>
            <p>
                Having found to its satisfaction, the efficiency of instruction, adequacy of the laboratory equipment in
                the
                science courses, the sufficiency of books in the library as well as the physical set-up of the school,
                then
                the Department of Instruction, through the Superintendent of Private Schools, Mr. Mcquaide, extended
                government recognition to the Imus Central Academy for its elementary, high school and vocational
                courses in
                the same year of its establishment.

                The original site of the school was the building of Pilar Lodge No. 15 (Free and Accepted Masonry)
                fronting
                the public plaza of Imus. The Administrative Officers and members of the faculty from 1923 to 1928 were:

            <span> &nbsp;</span>
            <p>
                In 1928, Dr. Eugenio Villanueva, Sr. took over the ownership and administration of the school, changing
                its
                name to Imus Institute and limiting its courses to Secondary Education. He lasted from 1929 to 1933. In
                1934, he devoted his time to his prosperous medical profession and transferred ownership to a newly
                formed
                corporation, including the Board of Directors and Officers. They were:
            </p>
            <span> &nbsp;</span>
            <p>Mr. Mariano Tirona - President | Dr. Lorenzo B. Paredes - Vice President | Mr. Melito Darvin - Secretary
                |
                Miss Fidela Buenaventura - Treasurer | Mr. Paulino Stuart - Member |</p>

            <p>Dr. Leoncio B. Monzon, Dr. Enriqueta Virata, and Mr. Zosimo Topacio joined the group, serving as
                President and Chairman from 1945 until his death in 1980. The school operated until World War II,
                opening for one year during the Japanese occupation. After liberalization in 1945, the Imus Institute
                opened again, offering a complete High School course. The College Department, founded in 1952, closed in
                1959 due to lack of enrollment.</p>
            <span> &nbsp;</span>
            <p>The Imus Institute, established in 1950, moved to a 2,884 square meter lot on D.T. Nueno Avenue due to a
                growing post-war student population. Construction began in March 1951, and the first Board of Trustees
                meeting took place in August 1951. After 28 years in the Pilar Lodge No. 15 building, the institute
                began accepting college students in 1952. The curriculum included a one-year Secretarial course and a
                two-year Liberal Arts course, eventually leading to the Bachelor of Science in Commerce degree. The
                College Department at the University of the Philippines offers a wide range of degrees, including
                Associate in Arts, Certificates in Secretarial Science, Associate in Secretarial Administration,
                Two-Year Junior Secretarial Course, BS Commerce majors in Management, Accounting, Finance, Banking and
                Finance, and more. The school also provides distance education, including Master of Arts in Education,
                Social Development, Business Administration, Nursing, Public Administration, Doctor of Education, and
                Business Management, in collaboration with Phillipine Women's University.</p>
            <span> &nbsp;</span>
            <p>Imus Institute built a four-story concrete building for fourth-year high school students in Poblacion,
                Imus, as part of its expansion and development program. The building was built after three of its main
                campus buildings were destroyed by fire in 2000. The Enriqueta Building was used for classes, but the
                institute continued its academic programs. The new M-Building was completed the following year. The High
                School Department, led by Architect Encarnacion N. Raralio, introduced computer-assisted learning in
                English, Mathematics, and Science. Additional buildings were added, including a covered wide stage,
                Science High School Building, and a rooftop for Physical Education classes. Starting 2006-2007, three
                secondary school curricula were introduced: Regular High School, Science and Adult High School, and
                Post-Secondary Certificate Course in Commercial Cooking. The Science High School curriculum caters to
                students pursuing Engineering and Science Education Programs, adding Advance Science, Statistics, and
                Mathematics with Computer Research in each year level.</p>
            <span> &nbsp;</span>
            <p>Imus Institute offers Adult High School to those who missed high school courses, allowing them to
                complete necessary credits for a diploma. The institute is committed to quality education and producing
                competent graduates. To comply with the K-12 Basic Education Program (R.A 10533) in the Philippines, the
                school has changed its name to Imus Institute of Science and Technology. The new name focuses on
                strengthening 21st-century skills for secondary to tertiary learners. The academic curricula, strategic
                plans, and instruction are integrated with advanced sciences and technology to train value-laden
                graduates and citizens. Imus Institute aims to become one of the best educational institutions in the
                Cavite province and prepare for university status.</p>
