                    <p> Imus Institute is the oldest, non-sectarian co-education private school in Cavite. It is the
                        first
                        private school in the province which offered a complete Academic Secondary Course recognized by
                        the
                        government. The school was founded by a group of concerned citizens of Imus led by Messrs.
                        Manuel
                        and Lorenzo Paredes. Its main objective was to provide elementary and secondary education to the
                        youth at a modest cost.

                        The foundation as well as the first key officers and members of the Board of Trustee of the
                        school
                        were the following: Mr. Manuel C. Paredes, President: Mr. Lorenzo B. Paredes, Vice President;
                        Mr.
                        Epifanio S. Paredes, Secretary; Mrs. Remedios Monzon-Paredes, Treasurer and Mr. Benito V.
                        Rementilla, Member of the Board.</p>

                    <p> In addition, an Honorary Board of Trustees was also organized and composed of the following:
                        Dean
                        Conrado Benitez, Honorary Chairman; Atty. Jacinto M. Kamantigue, Vice Chairman and Dr. Perpetuo
                        Gutierrez, Dr. Jose P. Tirona and Mr. Felix Paredes, Honorary Members.

                        On January 20, 1923, the Ymus Central Academy was founded and incorporated as a non-stock family
                        corporation under the Bureau of Commerce and Industry. However, the formal opening of classes
                        started on June 12, 1923 up to March 30, 1924, and thereafter from one school year to another.

                        Imus was chosen to be the site of this institution not only because the founders were residents
                        of
                        the town but also because of its proximity to the capital city of Manila and being one of the
                        biggest towns of Cavite. Historically, Imus was one of the major battlegrounds during the
                        revolution
                        of 1896. Physically, it is surrounded by fertile and bountiful rice fields providing an
                        invigorating
                        climate conducive to the demands of good education. Due to the presence of main lines of
                        transportation facilities, Imus is accessible from all points in the province.</p>
                    <p>
                        The founders of the Imus Central Academy, in their declaration of intent filed with the Bureau
                        of
                        Commerce and Industry, gave the following objectives and underlying philosophy for the
                        establishment
                        of the school:

                    Sr. During his administration,

                    Central Academy. Dr. Eugenio Villanueva's administration

                <p> Shortly thereafter Dr. Leoncio B. Monzon, Dr. Enriqueta Virata, Mr. Zosimo Topacio and others
                    joined
                    the group. Dr. Monzon served as President and Chairman from
                    1945 until his demise in 1980.The school continued to operate up to the outbreak of the Second
                    World
                    War on December 8, 1941, only to be opened for one school
                    year during the occupation of the Japanese Imperial Army. When liberalization came in 1945, the
                    Imus
                    Institute started to open its doors at its former
                    site and many students enrolled for the school year 1945-1946. Since then, up to the present,
                    the
                    Imus Institute has been offering a complete High School
                    course. The College Department was founded way back in 1952 but was forced to close in 1959 due
                    to
                    lack of necessary enrollment. It was reopened in 1971 and is being operated up to the present.

                <p> The greatly increased post-war student population made the Board of Trustees resolved in 1950 to
                    purchase a 2,884 square meter lot on D.T. Nueno Avenue.
                    Construction of the building started in March 1951 and the meeting of the Board of Trustees was
                    held
                    for the first time in the new site in August 1951 -
                    an indication of the fast pace of construction. After 28 years of holding classes in the Pilar
                    Lodge
                    No. 15 (freemasonry) Building. Imus Institute moved
                    to its new location. In 1952, having been granted permission to open a Junior College, the Imus
                    Institute started to accept college students in the first
                    semester of the academic year 1952-1953. The starting curricula were a one-year course in
                    Secretarial and a two-year Liberal Arts course leading to Associate
                    Science in Arts. Subsequently, the Secretarial curriculum leading to the Bachelor of Science in
                    Commerce degree was added. Much later, the Arts course was
                    lengthened to four years. The Imus Institute College Department produced its first batch of
                    Bachelor
                    of Arts graduates in 1984. The College Department
                    produced its first graduates in Associate in Arts in 1954; Certificates in Secretarial Science
                    in
                    1959; Associate in Secretarial Administration in 1972;
                    Two-Year Junior Secretarial Course in 1977; BS Commerce major in Management in 1979; BS Commerce
                    major in Accounting in 1980; BS Commerce major in Finance
                    in 1981; BS Commerce major in Banking and Finance in 1984; Bachelor of Elementary Education in
                    1989;
                    Bachelor of Secondary Education in 1990; Bachelor of
                    Science in Accountancy in 1995; BS Education major in English in 1997; Bachelor of Elementary
                    Education major in English and in Filipino in 1999; Bachelor
                    of Education major in Filipino and in English in 2000 and Bachelor of Science in Computer
                    Science in
                    2004. </p>

                <p> The school also offered distance education that tied up with Phillipine Women's University, and
                    includes Master of Arts in Education, Social Development,
                    Business Administration, Nursing, Public Administration, Doctor of Education and Business
                    Management.As part of its expansion and development program. Imus
                    Institute under the presidency of Atty. Manuel Paredes, built a four storey concrete building
                    for
                    the fourth year high school students in a 1.2 hectare lot
                    located at the Dimasalang Subdivision in Poblacion, Imus. It was indeed very timely that the
                    Dimasalang Campus was built because in November 25, 2000, three
                    of its buildings in the main campus were gutted by fire. These buildings contained fifty
                    classrooms,
                    the administrative offices, libraries, science laboratories, computer
                    rooms, school clinic, guidance center, and other offices. Because of this unfortunate incident,
                    schedule of classes had to be adjusted to accommodate high school
                    in the Dimasalang Campus. The college students held classes in the Enriqueta Building through
                    the
                    courtesy of Capt. Asisclo Casta√±eda. Amidst what happened,
                    Imus Institute still managed to continue its academic programs. Its new M-Building was completed
                    the
                    following year. </p>
                <p> With the modernization and integration of its information technology, the High School Department
                    under Architect Encarnacion N. Raralio, President and Chairman
                    of the Board of Trustees, introduced computer assisted learning in English, Mathematics and
                    Science
                    to equip its students. Additional buildings were constructed
                    in Dimasalang Campus: the covered wide stage in 2005 and in 2006, the Science High School
                    Building
                    and the covered rooftop for Physical Education classes at the E-building.
                    At the start of the school year 2006-2007, three secondary school curricula were offered:
                    Regular
                    (BEC) High School, Science and Adult High School, and Post-Secondary
                    Certificate Course in Commercial Cooking for technical skills development.The Science High
                    School
                    curriculum is relevant to the needs of students pursuing Engineering
                    and Science Education Programs in the tertiary level. It is the same as the regular High School
                    curriculum with added subjects such as Advance Science, Statistics and
                    Mathematics with Computer Research in every year level.The Adult High School is a program
                    offered to
                    individuals who missed some high school courses. This will
                    give the adult learners an opportunity to complete the credits they need for a diploma. </p>
                <p> Imus Institute is commited to maintain and develop a continuing program of quality and relevant
                    education. It has produced a number of successful students in the past and
                    will continue to do so in the years to come. It further improbes its quality of education in
                    order
                    to provide the country with competent and outstanding graduates. In
                    anticipation for this future goal, as well as for the compliance in the newest trend in the
                    education system in the Philippines which is the K-12 Basic Education Program
                    (R.A 10533), the school has changed the prestigious name from Imus Institute to Imus Institute
                    of
                    Science and Technology. The name carries the improved vision of strengthening
                    the 21st century skills of today's learners from secondary to tertiary level. The academic
                    curricula, strategic plans and differentiated instructions are all integrated with the
                    advanced sciences and technology that will surely help the community and the nations in training
                    value-laden and productive graduates and citizens and in exerting efforts to successfully
                    achieve the next level of accreditation. Along with the preparation for a university status,
                    Imus
                    Institute of Science and Technology is now in pursuit of working hard to attain a
                    name as one of the best educational institutions in the division and in the whole Cavite
                    province.
